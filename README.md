üîé **Smart, Fast and Extensible Build System**

## Development server

### Serving Project `web`

In order to serve the `Next` application, residing in `./apps/web`, execute:

```shell
npx nx run web:serve
```

The app should be accessible under http://localhost:4200.

### Serving Project `server`

In order to serve the `Nest` application, residing in `./apps/server`, execute:

```shell
npx nx run server:serve
```

The app should be accessible under http://localhost:3333/api.

### Parallell Serve

In order to execute both the `Next` and `Nest` applications, execute:

```shell
npx nx run-many --target=serve --projects=web,server
```

### Formatting the Whole Project

The whole project source code can be formatted by executing:

```shell
npx nx format:write
```

## Build & Run

The system can be built in two steps.

1. Build the `web` and `server` projects using `nx`:

```shell
npx nx run-many --target=build --projects=web,server
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

2. Build the Docker services:

```shell
docker-compose build
```

The full system can be started by executing:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

### Accessing App Components

Only the `web` and `server` components are exposed publicly. They can be accessed both with and without using SSL. Please note that self-signed SSL certificates are generated upon container startup, hence your browser will complain about security risks when visiting any of the below HTTPS links.

- `web`:
  - [http://localhost](http://localhost)
  - [https://localhost](https://localhost)
- `server`:
  - [http://localhost:3333/api](http://localhost:3333/api)
  - [https://localhost:8443/api](https://localhost:8443/api)

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

## Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
