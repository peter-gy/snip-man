## One-liner App Start

```shell
docker build . -t snip-man:nx-base && docker-compose up --build
```

The app start might take up to 10-15 minutes based on your internet connection and your machine's performance. The
system will be fully functional, once `snip-man-prisma-migrate` exits with code `0`. Please note that it is possible
that `snip-man-prisma-migrate` will exit with code `1` first, indicating an error, but this will be the case iff the
mongo replica set `snip-man-mongo` starts up too slow. The system will self-heal automatically, you should just wait
until you see `snip-man-prisma-migrate exited with code 0` in your logs.

You will be able to access the app via `https://localhost`. You will need to accept the self-signed certificates, or
ignore them in your browser. Both of the urls below need to be accessible by your browser:

- `https://localhost`
- `https://localhost:8443/api-docs/`

## Development Environment

The development environment of this project is fully dockerized via `Dockerfile.dev` and `docker-compose.dev.yml`. The
setup makes it possible to edit the source files locally and run the `nx` commands inside a docker container. In
addition, the database services can be also managed via `docker-compose`.

Steps to start the development environment:

1. Build and run the services: `make dev-up`
2. Start Nx services of your choice (scripts in `package.json` might be helpful)

Note that the repository root gets mounted bi-directionally into the `/usr/snip-man-dev/` directory of the `nx-dev`
service, therefore file-system changes made on the host will be immediately present inside the container, and
vice-versa.

The `web` and `server` components can be served in development mode at once by executing `npm run project:serve`.

### Truly Local Development

Install node modules:

```shell
npm install
```

Start the database instances with Docker and serve the project from your local machine:

```shell
make dev-up-local
```

The following services will be started:

- `postgres`: `localhost:15432`
- `mongo`: `localhost:37017`
- `server`: `localhost:3333`
- `web`: `localhost:4200`

## Production Build & Run

The system can be built using Docker only:

1. Build the base `nx` image:

```shell
docker build . -t snip-man:nx-base
```

Note that this base image containing the whole repository source is necessary for the build to succeed,
as `nx` needs access to the whole monorepo to do shared module transpilation and more advanced dependency-graph based
dependency resolution.

2. Build the Docker services:

```shell
docker-compose build
```

The full system can be started by executing:

```shell
docker-compose up
```

**Convenience command to execute the steps above at once:**

Using pure `bash`:

```shell
docker build . -t snip-man:nx-base && docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

Using `make`:

```shell
make prod-up
```

### Accessing App Components

Only the `web` and `server` components are exposed publicly. They can be accessed both with and without using SSL.
Please note that self-signed SSL certificates are generated upon container startup, hence your browser will complain
about security risks when visiting any of the below HTTPS links.

- `web`:
  - [http://localhost](http://localhost)
  - [https://localhost](https://localhost)
- `server`:
  - [http://localhost:3333/api](http://localhost:3333/api)
  - [https://localhost:8443/api](https://localhost:8443/api)

Please note that it is necessary to ignore SSL certificate errors with browsers when visiting the above links.

- `macOS`, `Chromium`: `open /Applications/Chromium.app --args --ignore-certificate-errors`
- `Windows`, `Chrome`: using flag `--ignore-certificate-errors`

## Working with `nx`

### Serving Project `web`

In order to serve the `Next` application, residing in `./apps/web`, execute:

```shell
npx nx run web:serve
```

The app should be accessible under http://localhost:4200.

### Serving Project `server`

In order to serve the `Nest` application, residing in `./apps/server`, execute:

```shell
npx nx run server:serve
```

The app should be accessible under http://localhost:3333/api.

### Parallel Serve

In order to execute both the `Next` and `Nest` applications, execute:

```shell
npx nx run-many --target=serve --projects=web,server
```

### Formatting the Whole Project

The whole project source code can be formatted by executing:

```shell
npx nx format:write
```

### Understand your workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
